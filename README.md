A beautiful dark theme for modern screens. Handcrafted uses colours from the CIELAB colour space. Each colour in the palette has an intentional level of brightness. This gives a sense of order and hierarchy to your editor.

The palette strikes the perfect balance between dreamy pastels and high contrast. The colours use a harmonic relationship and run through the entire spectrum.

Handcrafted has been created by [Hand Engineering](https://hand.engineering). This theme is based on their theme for the macOS Terminal.app.
